While augmented reality apps getting you outside and moving like pokemon go and digimon are on the rise, we noticed a key problem that these apps only encourage you to interact with pre-existing friends or play minigames by yourself. With our product, Capybara, we aim to use Augmented reality to instead broaden your social network and connect you with new people. 

We created a narrative app that allows you to raise a puppy. As you interact with the puppy, it uses a large language model to better learn your behavior and interests. It then connects you with other users when you walk around in augmented reality. Your dog can signal if youâ€™re feeling social, not looking to interact, or even go on incognito.
