# Paw Pals Connect

While apps like Pokémon Go and Digimon have done a great job getting people moving, they often miss something crucial: real opportunities to expand your social circle. These games focus on interactions with pre-existing friends or solo mini-games, but we believe augmented reality can do so much more. That’s where Capybara steps in. Our narrative-driven app lets you raise an adorable virtual puppy that adapts to you. Using a cutting-edge large language model, your pup learns your habits, interests, and personality as you play. But here’s the best part—when you’re out and about in augmented reality, your dog works its magic to connect you with other users nearby.

Feeling chatty? Your pup can signal that you’re ready to meet new people. Not in the mood? Set it to "incognito" or let your puppy politely signal “no thanks” to others. It’s all about creating meaningful connections, tailored entirely to you.

With Capybara, augmented reality isn’t just about games—it’s about building a community.
